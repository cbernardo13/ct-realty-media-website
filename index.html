          <h2>Why Choose CT Realty Media - Premium Real Estate Photography</h2>
          <p>
            In today's competitive real estate market, premium photography and media are no longer optional — they're
            essential.
            According to the National Association of Realtors, over 97% of home buyers begin their search online, and
            listings with
            professional photography receive significantly more views and sell faster than those without. At CT Realty
            Media, we
            specialize in creating stunning visual content that helps Connecticut real estate agents and brokers stand
            out.
          </p>

            videos,
            FAA-certified drone and aerial imaging, and immersive 3D virtual tours. Every shoot is handled with
